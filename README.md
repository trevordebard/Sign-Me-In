### Purpose:
---
This web app is designed as an all encompassing attendance-tracking service for clubs, organizations, teachers, etc. to easily and seamlessly take attendance of large groups.


### How To Use:
---
1. Visit signmein.org, and click "Generate room" to generate a room.

2. You may select options you want from users such as phone number or email.

3. Once the room is created, users can visit signmein.org and enter the room code. I suggest displaying the room code on a large projector, so that users can see their name appear in the room after they join.

4. After they enter the room code, they will be prompted to input the information the room creator requested, and the room creator will instantly see users appear on the screen. 


### Key Technologies:
---
- JavaScript (mostly ES6 syntax)
- Node.js
- React
- <span>Socket.</span>io
